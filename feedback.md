### Project Feedback + Evaluation

Your instructors will be grading you using this rubric.

For each criterion below, instructors will give you a score according to the following guidelines. "Ticking" all of the boxes for a criterion will earn a "meets expectations".

They will also assign a **Total Score**, to serve as an overall gauge of whether you met the project goals. However, __the more important scores are the individual ones__, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!

| Score | Expectations |
| :---- | :----------- |
| **0** | _Does not meet expectations_ |
| **1** | _Meets expectactions_ |
| **2** | _Exceeds expectations_ |

## Project Workflow - Meets expectations
##### How effectively did you plan, execute, and present this project?
- The `readme.md` file contains any necessary installation instructions

> You'll want to update the readme as described [here](https://github.com/ga-dc/project2#deliverables). You'll want too add it to get the project ready for your portfolio.

- The `planning` folder contains:
  - a picture / screenshot of your ERD (up to date!)

  > :+1: A new erd with favorites would be good to have if you want a reference for join-tables in your own work

  - a `wireframes` directory, which in turn contains at least 2 drawings or photos of wireframes and ERDs

  > Do you have your wireframes to add. PDFs of the Pages wireframes you made would be really good to add

  - a `user_stories.md` file, which in turn contains at least 7 user stories (or a link to a Trello board or equivalent)

  :+1: Excellent!

- A Github issue was submitted to the `project2` repository **by 11:00am on Friday, November 20<sup>th</sup>,** containing a link to a hosted video

> :+1:

- The video itself and/or the site on which it can be found contains a website or e-mail address through which the creator can be contacted

> :+1:

- The video is at least 3 minutes long, but **no more than** 5 minutes

> :+1:

- The video contains:
  - A description and demo of the app :+1:
  - A code sample explaining one thing of which the creator is proud :+1:
  - One thing the creator would do differently next time
  - The next feature the creator would like to implement :+1:

## Technical Requirements - Exceeds expectations
##### How well does your app demonstrate a grasp of the technologies introduced in class?
- The app contains at least 2 models

> :+1: 4!

- The app contains at least 1 association

> :+1: several relationships including a has many through. Nice!

- At least 1 model incorporates `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` routes

> :+1: Both prompts and chapters do. Good work!


## Creativity / Interface - Meets expectations
##### How memorable and enjoyable to use is your app?
- The app displays a personal spin or creative element through its written language, functionality, purpose, and/or CSS

> :+1: You did a great job on this project in that you used it as an opportunity to practice the fundamentals in a way that was interesting and unique. Great job!

- The app delivers something of value to the end user: it is not just a login button and an index page

> :+1: Really neat idea. Great implementation as is and a solid foundation to build on if you'd like.

## Code Quality - Meets expectations
##### How able would an uninformed programmer be to reuse and extend your code?
- The code follows style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, indenting, modularity, and semantic naming

> :+1: Code is clean and easy to read.

- The code is commented only with what is necessary to document what is happening in the code

> :+1: Not many comments but code is pretty clear.

- For any page, copying its source code as it appears in the **browser** and pasting it into the [W3 Validator](http://validator.w3.org) yields 0 errors

> Had a few errors in the validator. Be sure to check the html that templates are generating. Especially with helpers, it's easy to overlook little bugs in the html

## Deployment and Functionality - Meets expectations
##### How accessible is your app to those who may want to explore it?
- Cursory use of the app by an uninformed user yields no errors that "break" it

> :+1: App works really well. Didn't run into any errors. Really like the seed prompts

- The app is deployed to Heroku (or another hosting service)

> :+1:

- The contents of the creator's Github repository is identical to that of the Heroku repository

> :+1:

- The `URL` field of the Github repository contains a link to the deployed version of the app

:+1:
